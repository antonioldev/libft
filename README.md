Libft is a comprehensive library project developed as part of the curriculum at 42.
This project aims to replicate the functionality of several standard C library functions, providing a solid foundation for future projects and programming tasks.
The library includes essential functions such as:
  Character classification (isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint)
  String manipulation (strlen, memset, bzero, memcpy, memmove, strlcpy, strlcat, toupper, tolower, strchr, strrchr, strncmp, memchr, memcmp, strnstr, atoi, calloc, strdup)
  Operations for dealing with linked lists.

This repository contains efficient, handcrafted implementations of these functions, designed to be robust and reliable.
Whether you're a beginner honing your skills or an experienced developer looking for a lightweight library, Libft is a valuable resource for C programming enthusiasts.
